Worldwide, 1 in 3 women have experienced physical or sexual violence — mostly by an intimate partner. When accounting for sexual harassment, this figure is even higher. Worldwide, almost 3 in 5 women killed were killed by their partners or family in 2017. 
In order to be considered violence against women, the act must be committed solely because the victim is female.
Sexual harassment includes non-contact forms, like sexual comments about a person’s body parts or appearance, whistling, demands for sexual favors, 
sexually suggestive staring, stalking, and exposing one’s sexual organs at someone. It also includes physical contact forms, like grabbing, pinching, slapping, or 
rubbing against another person in a sexual way.

<strong>Most of the crimes don't even get reported and are left unresolved. Approximately 15 million adolescent girls (aged 15 to 19) worldwide have experienced forced 
sex at some point in their life. And India ranks 133 in the women, peace and security index rating.
