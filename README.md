# Inspiration âš¡ 
Worldwide, 1 in 3 women have experienced physical or sexual violence â€” mostly by an intimate partner. When accounting for sexual harassment, this figure is even higher. Worldwide, almost 3 in 5 women killed were killed by their partners or family in 2017. 
In order to be considered violence against women, the act must be committed solely because the victim is female.
Sexual harassment includes non-contact forms, like sexual comments about a personâ€™s body parts or appearance, whistling, demands for sexual favors, 
sexually suggestive staring, stalking, and exposing oneâ€™s sexual organs at someone. It also includes physical contact forms, like grabbing, pinching, slapping, or 
rubbing against another person in a sexual way.

<strong>Most of the crimes don't even get reported and are left unresolved. Approximately 15 million adolescent girls (aged 15 to 19) worldwide have experienced forced 
sex at some point in their life. And India ranks 133 in the women, peace and security index rating.

# What it does ðŸ¤–

## FemBot is a twitter bot that helps get tweets related to gender related crimes more traction on twitter and increase their reach. Our project aims to contribute towards making sure incidents donâ€™t go unnoticed by authorities and get more attention because of being in the public domain.

# How We built it ðŸ’¡

1. First we extracted a certain number of tweets having hashtags related to crime against women, and supporting women.
2. Once the tweets are retrieved, we perform sentiment analysis on them to figure out whether the tweets are spreading awareness about women crimes or empowering women, asking for immediate help. Besides, spam tweets are omitted.
3. For training our model we collected tagged twitter data and pre-processed it. The tweets were labelled as either positive or negative.
We used spaCy for text classification which is an open-source python NLP library. Thus, training data was prepared and the model was trained for 10 epochs
 <strong>The auto retweet and reply features have been implemented using the twitter API and the Python tweepy library. </strong> 
4. This model is then used to classify the extracted tweets and also tag appropriate authorities as per the sentiment to bring crimes to their notice for immediate help.
 The auto retweet and reply features have been implemented using the twitter API and the Python tweepy library.


# Challenges we ran into ðŸ§ 

- 1. Creating a model to perform sentiment analysis with a good model accuracy. 
- 2. Using the API keeping in mind the rate limit for Twitter API.
- 3. Creating Statistics data for the website. 
- 4. Deploying the bot. 

# Accomplishments that we are proud of ðŸ˜Œ
## We created a completely functional twitter bot, which can make a small difference in society. We successfully embedded all the tweets and created stats for our website.

# What we learned ðŸ¤©
We learned how to use the Twitter API and fetch realtime data for the website. 

# What's next for Fem-Bot ðŸ“ˆ
## âž¡ Tag authorities based on the geographic location
Currently the bot tags international authorities. It can be made versatile enough to tag authorities based on the geographic location of the twitter user and the crimes.
## âž¡ Improve the sentiment analysis model
The accuracy of the sentiment analysis model can be increased in the future.
## âž¡ Extend the bot to other crime genres
Fembot mainly focuses on gender related crimes and more prominently those against women. This model can be used for other genres of crime and be made more inclusive for other communities.
